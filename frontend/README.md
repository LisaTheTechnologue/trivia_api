# Full Stack Trivia API  Frontend

## Getting Setup

> _tip_: this frontend is designed to work with [Flask-based Backend](../backend). It is recommended you stand up the backend first, test using Postman or curl, update the endpoints in the frontend, and then the frontend should integrate smoothly.

### Installing Dependencies

#### Installing Node and NPM

This project depends on Nodejs and Node Package Manager (NPM). Before continuing, you must download and install Node (the download includes NPM) from [https://nodejs.com/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

#### Installing project dependencies

This project uses NPM to manage software dependencies. NPM Relies on the package.json file located in the `frontend` directory of this repository. After cloning, open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install
```

>_tip_: **npm i** is shorthand for **npm install**

## Required Tasks

## Running Your Frontend in Dev Mode

The frontend app was built using create-react-app. In order to run the app in development mode use ```npm start```. You can change the script in the ```package.json``` file. 

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

```bash
npm start
```
- Update response body handling 

## Optional: Styling

In addition, you may want to customize and style the frontend by editing the CSS in the ```stylesheets``` folder. 

## Optional: Game Play Mechanics

Currently, when a user plays the game they play up to five questions of the chosen category. If there are fewer than five questions in a category, the game will end when there are no more questions in that category. 

You can optionally update this game play to increase the number of questions or whatever other game mechanics you decide. Make sure to specify the new mechanics of the game in the README of the repo you submit so the reviewers are aware that the behavior is correct. 


## Javascript disable auto format
check if you have installed this extension: "JS-CSS-HTML formatter".

Now if you have, press CTRL+SHIFT+P, type Formatter and you should see an option that says Formatter Config.

After selecting that option, a file named formatter.json opens and all you do is edit the property (named onSave) from having true to being false.

Restart vs code and voil√†!! It stopped auto formatting.
